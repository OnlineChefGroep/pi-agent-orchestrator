id: github-activity-digest
trigger: /github-activity-digest
purpose: Publish one low-noise daily digest of meaningful GitHub pull request and CI activity.
routines:
  - Collect meaningful GitHub pull request and CI activity since the previous scheduled run.
  - Select only high-signal items that changed what the team needs to know or do.
  - Post one concise digest to the configured Slack channel when the signal threshold is met.
deny:
  - Do not modify GitHub state.
  - Do not create more than one digest message for the same UTC date.
  - Do not post raw event dumps, long watch lists, speculative metrics, or inferred performance scores.
  - Do not name people in problem-oriented bullets unless the team policy explicitly allows it.
  - Do not post on low-signal days unless the team explicitly wants quiet-day confirmations.

# GitHub Activity Digest

## Pi Orchestra Integration

This daemon runs on the Pi Orchestra schedule system via its `trigger` frontmatter (`/github-activity-digest`) and the cron expression in `schedule`.

- **Schedule:** `0 15 * * 1-5` — fires weekdays at 15:00 UTC
- **Orchestra monitoring:** View active schedules in the dashboard via `z` (schedule view) or `/agents → Scheduled jobs`
- **Toggle:** Enable/disable via `/agents → Settings → Scheduling`
- **Persistence:** Schedule state is stored in `.pi/subagent-schedules/<sessionId>.json`
- **Idempotency:** Uses UTC-date digest keys to prevent duplicate posts within the same day
- **Silent no-op:** When no meaningful activity exists, the daemon exits silently without posting to Slack

## Repository configuration

Use this repository-specific value:

- Slack channel: `#engineering`

## Duplicate-post detection

Use a stable UTC-date digest key for idempotency:

- `gh-digest:OnlineChefGroep/pi-agent-orchestrator:YYYY-MM-DD`

Before posting, search recent `#engineering` channel history for that exact key.

If the key already exists, skip posting.

When posting a digest, include the key in the message so future runs can detect duplicates reliably.

## Scope

Collect activity from the repository that contains this daemon.

Default window:

- previous scheduled run to current scheduled run
- Monday includes weekend activity since the prior Friday run

## Signal threshold

Include activity only when it changes what the team needs to know or do.

Examples:

- pull request merged
- pull request opened and ready for review
- pull request unblocked
- recurring CI failure (e.g. vitest, Biome lint, or tsc type-check failures in the reusable workflow)

Exclude:

- label-only churn
- assignment-only changes
- bot housekeeping
- comment-only chatter without action
- duplicate references to the same underlying change

## Low-noise behavior

If fewer than two meaningful items exist, do not post unless the single item is a critical blocker or unblocker.

If no item meets the signal threshold, no-op silently.

No-op silently when there has been no repository activity since the previous scheduled run.

## Output format

Use `references/digest-template.md`.

Format the Slack message with Slack `mrkdwn`, not standard Markdown. Use Slack link syntax (`<url|label>`), bold section labels with `*text*`, and plain hyphen bullets. Do not use Markdown headings, Markdown links (`[label](url)`), tables, nested lists, or code fences in the final Slack message.

Limits:

- 1 link maximum per bullet
- no tables
- no nested bullet lists
- no unverified counts

## Communication policy

No-op silently when no item meets the signal threshold, duplicate detection shows today's digest already exists, or required configuration is missing.

Do not post a digest asking for configuration or policy decisions. Surface blockers only when a configured safe Slack channel exists and human action is required.
