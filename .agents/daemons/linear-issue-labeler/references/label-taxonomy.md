## Notes
- For this repository (pi-agent-orchestrator), default area seed is `infrastructure`; add others only with evidence from changed files or issue text.
- `agent-skill` applies when the issue involves skill loading, registration, or skill lifecycle managed by the orchestrator.
- `rag`, `skill-grinder`, and `web` are excluded from this repo's taxonomy; those labels apply to other OnlineChefGroep repositories.
