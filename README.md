# @onlinechefgroep/pi-agent-orchestrator

> Multi-agent orchestration for the Pi coding agent: autonomous subagents,
> isolated worktrees, swarms, schedules, structured handoffs, prompt compression,
> and live terminal observability.

## Install or try it immediately

Install globally in Pi:

```bash
pi install npm:@onlinechefgroep/pi-agent-orchestrator
```

Try the published package for one session without changing your settings:

```bash
pi -e npm:@onlinechefgroep/pi-agent-orchestrator
```

For a project-local install:

```bash
pi install npm:@onlinechefgroep/pi-agent-orchestrator -l
```

Requires Node.js 22.19.0 or newer and `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.80.10 or newer.
Use `pi install`; running `npm install` alone does not register the package resources with Pi.

## Why this package

| Capability | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| Autonomous subagents | Explore, Plan, Analysis, general-purpose, and custom agents with bounded execution |
| Parallel orchestration | Background groups, swarms, structured handoffs, and controlled concurrency |
| Safe isolation | Permission inheritance, partition filtering, budgets, depth limits, and optional git worktrees |
| Operator control | Interactive `/agents` dashboard, live status, steering, termination, schedules, and performance views |
| Ready-made workflows | A progressive-disclosure orchestration skill and audit, plan, and implementation prompt templates |
| Local execution | No hosted control plane, no package-owned telemetry backend, and no package-owned data service |

The extension runs inside the Pi host process. It does not make outbound network calls of its own and does not store user data on a hosted service.

## Real terminal showcase

The preview is rendered from the compiled dashboard, resource top view, and widget implementation. Remotion supplies the framing and encoding; the terminal content comes from the actual product renderers.

## First useful run

Start Pi with the package, then run the packaged audit template:

```text
/orchestra-audit src
```

Open the control surface while the agents run:

```text
/agents
```

Useful controls:

- `j` / `k` or arrows: navigate agents
- `Space`: multi-select
- `t`: resource top view
- `z`: daemon schedules
- `Shift+K`: terminate selected agents
- `?`: help
- `/perf`: performance metrics

The Pi footer can expose live running and queued counts through the `subagents` status slot.

## Packaged Orchestra workflows

The npm package includes one skill and three prompt templates. Pi loads only the skill description into the system prompt; the full workflow is read on demand.

| Command | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `/skill:pi-orchestra` | Load the complete evidence-first orchestration operating model |
| `/orchestra-audit [scope]` | Run three parallel read-only audits and synthesize ranked findings |
| `/orchestra-plan <goal>` | Gather evidence in parallel and produce a mechanically verifiable plan |
| `/orchestra-implement <goal>` | Discover, plan, implement in one isolated writer, and independently verify |

The templates deliberately avoid automatic merge, publish, tag, or deploy actions unless those actions are explicitly part of the request.

## Built-in agent types

| Type | Mode | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Explore | read-only | Parallel codebase discovery and evidence collection |
| Plan | read-only | Architecture and implementation planning before edits |
| Analysis | read-only + `ctx_*` | Sandboxed data or compute through optional `@onlinechef/context-mode` |
| general-purpose | full tools | Bounded implementation and multi-step execution |

Create project agents in `.pi/agents/*.md`. See [Custom Agents](docs/custom-agents.md) for the complete frontmatter schema.

## Core capabilities

- **Interactive TUI dashboard** — agent list, resource top, daemon schedules, performance metrics, help, and settings.
- **Subagent lifecycle** — spawn, queue, steer, stop, inspect, and collect structured results.
- **Permission inheritance** — children cannot silently regain tools or scopes removed by a parent.
- **Worktree isolation** — optional branch and filesystem isolation for implementation agents.
- **Prompt compression profiles** — static system-prompt guidance with global defaults and per-agent overrides; this does not compact conversation history.
- **Persistent scheduling** — cron, interval, and one-shot jobs with a daemon schedule view.
- **Structured handoffs** — machine-readable transfer between agents and chained workflows.
- **Swarm coordination** — dynamic membership and coordinated completion.
- **Cross-extension RPC** — capability-based integration for trusted peer extensions.

Default orchestration mode is `single`; multi-agent modes are opt-in.
